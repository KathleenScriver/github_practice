## Warmup
- Take 3 minutes and research Distributed Version Control System (like Git!)

## Version Control System
- Can give you off network access
- More security concerns
- Allows multiple people to work at the same time
- More collaboration

## Git Flow
**Stage, Commit, Push**

**I Do**
(add new file)
```
  - git status (discuss staging)
  - git add <filename>
  - git status (discuss committing)
  - git commit -m "message here"
  - git push origin master
```

**Turn and Talk: What is a local repo vs a remote repo?**
(discuss local vs remote)

**You Do With Me**
- How to set up a local repo and a remote repo.
- Wire local to talk to remote.

**Work with Partner**

- Add some content.
- Stage, commit, push changes to your remote repo.

## Deliverable
_Slack to me:_
